# LearningAgileFlight_SE3
Learning Agile Flights on SE(3): a novel deep SE(3) motion planning and control method for quadrotors. It learns an MPC's adaptive SE(3) decision variables parameterized by a portable DNN, encouraging the quadrotor to fly through the gate with maximum safety margins under diverse settings.
